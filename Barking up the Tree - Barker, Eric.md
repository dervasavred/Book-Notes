## Chapter 1

Synopsis: Statistical outliers perform well in situations that favor their specific extreme trait. People that did well in school (valedictorians, etc) don't necessarily translate to big successes.

1. Statistical outliers may perform poorly on average but have advantages elsewhere.
   Michael Phelps has a long torso and wingspan, making him an excellent swimmer but a poor overall athlete.
   5-time RAAM champion (NAME?) wins endurance cycling competitions because he might be experiencing disassociation episodes similar to Don Quixote; he doesn't feel fatigue or pain the way other athletes might.
   Extreme outliers might not be good leaders for normal times but can be the perfect (subjective to author) fit for extreme times (see Churchill).
